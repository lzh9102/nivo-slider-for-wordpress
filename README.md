Nivo Slider for Wordpress
-------------------------

This plugin is taken from [Nivo Slider for Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nivo-slider-for-wordpress/)
on the wordpress website.  The original plugin works very well, but the
navigation bullets don't show up even when *Show the navigation bullets* is
checked. I modified the plugin so that a row of bullets are shown at the
top-left corner of the slide when the option is checked. Tested with Wordpress
3.4.2.

Please read the original [readme](readme.txt) and [license](license.txt) for
more information about installation and redistribution rules.
